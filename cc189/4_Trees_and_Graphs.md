# Trees and Graphs

Note: not all binary trees are binary search trees

## Binary

* In-order: left, current, right
* Pre-order: current, left, right
* Post-order: left, right, current
* Insert node: insert value by comparing to the root and deciding which way to go

## Graph

* DFS
* BFS

```python
# check balance tree
class Tree(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.data = None
def getHeight
def isTreeBalanced:
