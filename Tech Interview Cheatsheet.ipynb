    "#### Definition:\n",
    "- Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0 based, index.\n",
    "- Based on [tuples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) from set theory.\n",
    "- They are one of the oldest, most commonly used data structures.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### What you need to know:\n",
    "- Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting (except at the end).\n",
    "- **Linear arrays**, or one dimensional arrays, are the most basic.\n",
    "  - Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size.\n",
    "- **Dynamic arrays** are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements.\n",
    "  - If a dynamic array is full, it copies it's contents to a larger array.\n",
    "- **Two dimensional arrays** have x and y indices like a grid or nested arrays.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Big O efficiency:\n",
    "- Indexing:         Linear array: O(1),      Dynamic array: O(1)\n",

    "#### Definition: \n",
    "- Stores data with **nodes** that point to other nodes.\n",
    "  - Nodes, at its most basic it has one datum and one reference (another node).\n",
    "  - A linked list _chains_ nodes together by pointing one node's reference towards another node.  \n",

    "#### What you need to know:\n",
    "- Designed to optimize insertion and deletion, slow at indexing and searching.\n",
    "- **Doubly linked list** has nodes that reference the previous node.\n",
    "- **Circularly linked list** is simple linked list whose **tail**, the last node, references the **head**, the first node.\n",
    "- **Stack**, commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too.\n",

    "  - Made with a linked list by having the head be the only place for insertion and removal.\n",

    "#### Definition: \n",
    "- Stores data with key value pairs.\n",
    "- **Hash functions** accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key. \n",
    "  - This is known as **hashing**, which is the concept that an input and an output have a one-to-one correspondence to map information.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What you need to know:\n",
    "- Designed to optimize searching, insertion, and deletion.\n",
    "- **Hash collisions** are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs.\n",

    "## Search Basics\n",
    "### **Breadth First Search**\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching levels of the tree first, starting at the root.\n",
    "  - It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left to right. \n",
    "  - While doing this it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current level.\n",
    "  - When finished examining a level it moves to the left most node on the next level.\n",
    "  - The bottom-right most node is evaluated last (the node that is deepest and is farthest right of it's level). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What you need to know:\n",
    "- Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than it is deep.\n",
    "- Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree.\n",
    "  - Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than **depth first search**.\n",
    "  - The queue uses more memory because it needs to stores pointers\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Big O efficiency:\n",
    "- Search: Breadth First Search: O(|E| + |V|)\n",
    "- E is number of edges\n",
    "- V is number of vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Depth First Search**\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching depth of the tree first, starting at the root.\n",
    "  - It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go further.\n",
    "  - Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right child of nodes on that branch, and if possible left from the right children.\n",
    "  - When finished examining a branch it moves to the node right of the root then tries to go left on all it's children until it reaches the bottom.\n",
    "  - The right most node is evaluated last (the node that is right of all it's ancestors). \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### What you need to know:\n",
    "- Optimal for searching a tree that is deeper than it is wide.\n",
    "- Uses a stack to push nodes onto.\n",
    "  - Because a stack is LIFO it does not need to keep track of the nodes pointers and is therefore less memory intensive than breadth first search.\n",
    "  - Once it cannot go further left it begins evaluating the stack.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Big O efficiency:\n",
    "- Search: Depth First Search: O(|E| + |V|)\n",
    "- E is number of edges\n",
    "- V is number of vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breadth First Search Vs. Depth First Search\n",
    "- The simple answer to this question is that it depends on the size and shape of the tree.\n",
    "  - For wide, shallow trees use Breadth First Search\n",
    "  - For deep, narrow trees use Depth First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuances:\n",
    "  - Because BFS uses queues to store information about the nodes and its children, it could use more memory than is available on your computer.  (But you probably won't have to worry about this.)\n",
    "  - If using a DFS on a tree that is very deep you might go unnecessarily deep in the search. See [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/761/) for more information.\n",
    "  - Breadth First Search tends to be a looping algorithm.\n",
    "  - Depth First Search tends to be a recursive algorithm."

    "#### Definition:\n",
    "- A comparison based sorting algorithm\n",

    "  - It repeats this process on the left side until it is comparing only two elements at which point the left side is sorted.\n",
    "  - When the left side is finished sorting it performs the same operation on the right side.\n",
    "- Computer architecture favors the quicksort process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What you need to know:\n",
    "- While it has the same Big O as (or worse in some cases) many other sorting algorithms it is often faster in practice than many other sorting algorithms, such as merge sort.\n",

    "  - It iterates left to right comparing every couplet, moving the smaller element to the left.\n",
    "  - It repeats this process until it no longer moves and element to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What you need to know:\n",
    "- While it is very simple to implement, it is the least efficient of these three sorting methods.\n",
    "- Know that it moves one space to the right comparing two elements at a time and moving the smaller on to left.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big O efficiency:\n",
    "- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n)\n",
    "- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n^2)\n",
    "- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge Sort Vs. Quicksort\n",
    "- Quicksort is likely faster in practice.\n",
    "- Merge Sort divides the set into the smallest possible groups immediately then reconstructs the incrementally as it sorts the groupings.\n",
    "- Quicksort continually divides the set by the average, until the set is recursively sorted."

    "- **Stack level too deep** and **stack overflow**.\n",
    "  - If you've seen either of these from a recursive algorithm, you messed up.\n",
    "  - It means that your base case was never triggered because it was faulty or the problem was so massive you ran out of RAM before reaching it.\n",
